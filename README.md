# PokerChip
This app fully simulates the game of Unlimited Texas Hold'em on iOS devices. With this app, players no longer need large amounts of heavy physical chips normally required for the game. Players can join a game hosted by anyone connecting to the same WiFi network. All a player has to do to join a game is click on Join Game and wait for the host's name to appear! This app completely follows the rules of the game, including four rounds of actions available (pre-flop, flop, turn, river). Furthermore, the application also automates the assignment of positions such as Dealer, Small Blind, and Big Blind. Also, the application also keeps track of user's chip count and automates the process of chip transferring to the winner of the pot of every hand. Whenever it's a player's turn, a player can make any valid move according to Texas Hold'em rules such as call, raise, fold, check, and also going ALL-IN! Players can also check other players' statistics that are stored persistently on each player's device by using the information icon ride beside each player. Below, we will first demonstrate the app and then go into the implementation details.
